# 👩🏻‍💻📓✍🏻💡 Challenge Set - July 2025 - Conversations

Part of the **Mobile Dev Campus Main App Challenge** by [Philipp Lackner](https://pl-coding.com/campus)

## Mini challenge 1 : [Easy] - Emoji Reaction Bubble
### 🎭 Scenario
Your friend group chat is pure chaos — every message sparks debate, and everyone’s tired of typing “lol” or “💀” every time. Build a simple emoji reaction bubble so users can tap a message, pick an emoji, and see who reacted with what (one per person, no duplicates).
### 🎯 Feature Goal
Create a tappable emoji reaction system for a chat interface. When the user taps an emoji, the reaction appears in a compact bubble inside the message, grouped with other users’ reactions.
